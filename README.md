## Alex Chernysh

**Solutions Architect & Glue Engineer**

Building the calm layer between chaos and clarity.

### What I Do
I design and operate resilient integrations across cloud, on-prem, and SaaS.  
As a glue engineer, I help teams make complex systems work reliably.

I specialize in:
- Production-ready data/AI pipelines
- LLM workflows (RAG, agents, automation)
- Platform reliability and developer productivity
