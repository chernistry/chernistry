## Alex Chernysh

**Staff Solutions Architect & Glue Engineer**

Building the calm layer between chaos and clarity.

### What I Do

I architect and build resilient systems that connect everything â€” cloud, on-prem, and SaaS platforms. As a "glue engineer", I'm the technical leader others rely on to make complex systems just work.

I specialize in:
- End-to-end data/AI pipelines that stay rock-solid in production
- LLM-powered solutions (RAG, agents, automation)
- Platform stability and developer velocity

### Impact

- **Production-grade pipelines**: Processing 10K+ events/sec with <5s latency
- **LLM-powered automation**: Built a mini-ATS that cut candidate triage time by 70%
- **Security innovation**: Automated threat scoring pipeline saving 18 hrs/week
- **Open-source contribution**: Created modular RAG framework with hybrid retrieval
